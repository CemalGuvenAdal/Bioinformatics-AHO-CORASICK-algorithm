# Bioinformatics-AHO-CORASICK-algorithm
In my program I have implemented the AHO-CORASICK algorithm. I have used the faiulare algorithm to find the nodes to countinue in case of failing by looking at the prefixes as it is tought in the course. Program creades a keyword tree
with an empty root and then it builds. I have used breadth first search for moving around the tree. I have also used argument parsing method that is asked for. Program is written in python.  I have opened my char array 
to be 128 ASCII characters because I didnt know what input is wanted in the program. All the results can be displayed by running the program. I am calling my print function inside of the AHO-CORASICK algorithm.
